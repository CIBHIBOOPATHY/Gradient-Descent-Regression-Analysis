# Regression-Analysis with Python
This repository contains an implementation of Multivariate Regression Analysis using the Gradient Descent algorithm. Multivariate regression is a statistical technique that uses multiple variables to predict the outcome of a response variable. 

## Features

- Implements Multivariate Linear Regression using Gradient Descent.
- Handles multiple predictors.
- Customizable learning rate and number of iterations.
- Easy-to-understand code with comments and documentation.

## Algorithm Explanation
Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function in linear regression. The steps are as follows:

- Initialize Parameters: Start with initial values for the parameters (often zeros).
- Compute Cost: Calculate the cost function (Mean Squared Error) for the current parameters.
- Compute Gradients: Calculate the gradients of the cost function with respect to each parameter.
- Update Parameters: Update the parameters using the gradients and the learning rate.
- Repeat: Repeat steps 2-4 until the cost function converges or the maximum number of iterations is reached.

## Datasets
Two datasets are readily available to run the code in this repository
